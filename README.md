# Single Responsibility Principle

### What is the Single Responsibility Principle in C#?

`The Single Responsibility Principle states that “Each software module or class should have only one reason to change“. In other words, we can say that each module or class should have only one responsibility to do.
So we need to design the software in such a way that everything in a class or module should be related to a single responsibility. That does not mean your class should contain only one method or property, you can have multiple members (methods or properties) as long as they are related to a single responsibility or functionality.
So, with the help of SRP, the classes become smaller and cleaner and thus easier to maintain.`
